- My Chinese name is 王一飞, consisting of three of the easiest Chinese characters. Yifei is a common first name, but depending on the specific characters, it can have different meaings. Disambiguation: I am ``~Yifei_Wang1`` on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yifei_Wang1):)

- I grew up near the Yellow river, and I used to travel across a [pontoon bridge](yellowriver.png) every week to go to school before colledge.

- I enjoy road trips with my wife. We have been to Tibet (reversely from Lhasa to Chengdu along the 318 Road) in summer 2023 with an offroad. We have also visited Yunnan multiple times—the clouds and trails there are unbeatable.

- I can dive 35 meters deep with Nitrox. Here is [me with a turtle](turtle.jpeg).

- I am interested in political and moral philosophy and religous studies. I obtained a double Bechelor's degree in philosophy at Peking University. Zengding Wu ([吴增定](https://phil.pku.edu.cn/szdw/szll/llxjys/274750.htm)) was my thesis advisor. I quite enjoyed the time digging into Nietzsche's every book and discussed it weekly with Zengding.
