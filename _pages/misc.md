- My Chinese name is 王一飞, consisting of three of the easiest Chinese characters. Yifei is a common first name, but depending on the specific characters, it can have different meaings. Disambiguation: I am ``~Yifei_Wang1`` on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yifei_Wang1):)

- I grew up near the Yellow river, and I used to travel across a [pontoon bridge](yellowriver.png) every week to go to school before colledge.

- I enjoy road trips with my wife. We have been to Tibet (reversely from Lhasa to Chengdu along the 318 Road) in summer 2023 with a offroad. We have also visited Yunnan multiple times—the clouds and trails there are unbeatable.

- I can dive 35 meters deep with Nitrox. Here is [me with a turtle](turtle.jpeg).

- I did a double Bechelor's degree in philosophy at Peking University. I am mostly interested in political and moral philosophy and religous studies. Zengding Wu ([吴增定](https://phil.pku.edu.cn/szdw/szll/llxjys/274750.htm)) was my undergraduate thesis advisor. I quite enjoyed the time digging into Nietzsche's every book and discussed it weekly with Zengding.
