I work on understanding and advancing the machine learning principles in foundation models (esp LLMs), with major interests in self-supervised learning, long-context learning, reasoning, and safety ([overview](/research)). My recent papers on these topics received [4 best paper awards](./awards) and were featured by [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2025/unpacking-large-language-model-bias-0617), [CSAIL News](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/machines-self-adapt-new-tasks-without-re-training), and [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/many-shot-jailbreaking). I serve as an Area Chair for ICLR and review for ICML, NeurIPS, JMLR, PNAS.

I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Peking University, advised by [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io), [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), and [Jiansheng Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69984.htm). Previously, I received a B.S. in Data Science from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, advised by [Tong Lin](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1177/1360.htm), and a B.A. in Philosophy from Peking University, advised by [Zengding Wu](https://phil.pku.edu.cn/szdw/szll/llxjys/274750.htm).
