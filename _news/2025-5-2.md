Three papers were accepted to ICML 2025. Our **oral presentation (top 1%)** introduces [contrastive sparse representations (CSR)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01776) to compress state-of-the-art embedding models to just 32 active dimensions, enabling ~100Ã— faster retrieval with minimal accuracy loss and low training cost for large-scale vector databases and RAG systems.
