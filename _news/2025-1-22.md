5 papers were accepted at ICLR 2025 (3 as a co-first author)! We proposed <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=fL4qWkSmtM">long-context perplexity</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=q1UyoY3MgJ">invariant in-context learning</a> for better training and usage of LLMs. We also looked into some fundamental questions, such as <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=INe4otjryz">OOD generalization of in-context learning</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=g6Qc3p7JH5">interplay between monosemanticity and robustness</a>, and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=L0evcuybH5">the nature of projection heads</a>.
