<!-- Our recent work [Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776) stimulate [a lot interest](https://x.com/yifeiwang77/status/1897023662328611062) in the community as an alternative paradigm for efficient embedding. -->

Our recent work [Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776) has sparked [significant interest](https://x.com/yifeiwang77/status/1897023662328611062) as a promising alternative paradigm for efficient embedding retrieval.
